# Landelayo

## Introduction
Landelayo is a set of Django REST API's to manage your calendars, events and their occurrences.

This project was inspired by [django-scheduler](https://pypi.org/project/django-scheduler/) project but with a narrower focus
and a REST API.


## Install And Setup
```commandline
pip install django-landelayo
```
Landelayo uses the `DefaultRouter` provided by the [django rest-framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/). 

To incorporate it into your projects `urls.py` file with your other apis, you can do the following
```python
from django.urls import include, path
from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter
from landelayo.urls import router as landelayo_router

# Your Main Project Router
router = DefaultRouter()
router.registry.extend(landelayo_router.registry)

urlpatterns = [
    path('api/v1/', include(router.urls)),
    ...
]
```

## ViewSets
